/*
Write a function called removePartyKillers that 
takes in an array like "playlist" (see below) and 
returns a copy of that playlist where any song longer 
than 8 minutes has been removed. You can safely assume 
that a playlist is an array of objects. Each object will 
have the properties title, artist, and durationInSeconds.


var awesomePlaylist = [
  {
    title: "Hay Day",
    artist: "Robo-Crop",
    durationInSeconds: 378
  }, {
    title: "10,000 Pounds",
    artist: "L-Ton Jonn",
    durationInSeconds: 498,
  }, {
    title: "Caesar's Salad",
    artist: "DJ Dinner Julius",
    durationInSeconds: 600,
  }, {
    title: "The British Are On Their Way",
    artist: "Raul Pevere",
    durationInSeconds: 1095,
  }, {
    title: "13th",
    artist: "The Doctors",
    durationInSeconds: 185,
  }
];


Would return:

[
  {
    title: "Hay Day",
    artist: "Robo-Crop",
    durationInSeconds: 378
  }, {
    title: "13th",
    artist: "The Doctors",
    durationInSeconds: 185,
  }
]

function removePartyKillers(playlist) {

}

removePartyKillers(awesomePlaylist);
