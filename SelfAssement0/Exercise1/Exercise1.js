Write function helloPerson which takes in a name input and logs 
a greeting to the console. Note, this function should not have a return value.

For example, if someone calls your function helloPerson(‘Petra’);

It should log exactly: “Hello, Petra”

Similarly, if your function were called with the argument “Juan”, 
it should log exactly: “Hello, Juan”

And so on..
