/*
Write a function myLaptopInfo which takes in no input values, 
and returns an object with the properties “type”, “color”, and “yearPurchased”. 
The values of each property is up to you, and you can explicitly type out these values, 
but these three properties should exist within the object your function returns.

For example, if myLaptopInfo were called, it would return:

{ type : 'Macbook Air', color : 'Burgundy', yearPurchased : 2016 }
*/

function myLaptopInfo(){
    return {
        type: 'Mac',
        color: 'gray',
        yearPurchased: 2018
    };
}
