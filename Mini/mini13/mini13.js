// Time limit 45 minutes
// Write a function atTheTone that takes in no input and returns a message giving the current time.
// HINT: Look up the Date object
// Note: If you use Date in repl.it it will give UTC time rather than your local time.  Make sure to adjust to your time zone.

function atTheTone() {
  
};

//called at 10:11am local time
atTheTone() //"The time is: 10 hour(s) and 11 minute(s)"

//called at 6:30pm local time
atTheTone() //"The time is: 18 hour(s) and 30 minute(s)"

/*Bonus you may customize your message however you like as long as it communicates the current time*/
